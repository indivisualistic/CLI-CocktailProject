# CLI::CocktailProject

This is not a test

Welcome to my Cocktail generator project, where not only will I recommend you a drink that you will enjoy, but also how to make it by providing you the ingredients and step by step instructions.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

`bundle install`
run `bin/run`


## Usage

Instuctions: It's pretty simple! When you run the generator, you'll be asked if you are interested in a drink. You will be given the option of saying yes, by pressing 1 or no, by pressing 2. Please be sure to select one of these options, for you just might not get what you were looking for! If you were satisfied with your drink, you'll now be given the option to get the ingredients and the directions by just pressing 1! If it wasn't for you or you're just plain not interested, you press 2 and you are all set. Maybe one drink is not enough...Well, here you have the choice of asking for another drink by following the same steps you did earlier. Have fun...drinks are on me!
